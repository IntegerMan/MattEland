        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a software developer / husband / Church preschool teacher / hobbyist / nerd with a love for
            most things creative, robotic, futuristic, and / or nerdy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I program in many different languages, though my day job pays me to work with .NET, ASP .NET,
            SQL Server, JavaScript, and WPF/Silverlight among other technologies.
        </p>

        <h2>About this Site</h2>
        <p>
            This site exists largely to host experimental projects, data, and web services, but if you're a
            human browsing the web or a machine that's become self aware, I hope you're enjoying your visit and
            getting something useful out of this.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, if you're wondering, yes, the site is supposed to look blue. I'm going for a 1980's console app
            look and feel.
        </p>
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>

                <li>Microsoft SQL Server 2012</li>
                <li>Windows Azure</li>
                <li>Bootstrap</li>
                <li>Theming derived from the Bootstrap 386 theme</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This site also relies on aggregation services written in:

                <li>Windows Services</li>
                <li>Python 2.7</li>
